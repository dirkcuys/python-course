#Arrowing our way trough

How does it feel, to be awesome? You’re now midway through the adventure. Hopefully you’ve had a good week of catching up, relaxing or working ahead and hanging with us on the [forum](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python)

#Reading
We will look into something called structures. I don't think they mean concrete buildings, but it sure sounds like they are just as important. You will find information about them in Chapters 7, 9 and 10 from [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/index.html).

##Doing
Codecademy also has some good exercises that will show us how to work with structures. Work on units called [Lists & Dictionaries] and [Student Becomes the Teacher](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python).


##Homework

* Complete sections 3.1 from Handout 3 of 6.189 [A Gentle Introduction to Computer Science](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/assignments/MIT6_189IAP11_hw3.pdf) 


As always, ask for help for help, or just hang with us on [our community forum](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python).

Keep on keepin’ on!
