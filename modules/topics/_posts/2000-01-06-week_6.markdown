#Ta-da, the end is near!

This is it.  The final week’s assignments.  I hope that you’ve learned some Python, made some friends and enjoyed hanging with me and our new friends. 
This is not really the end, because I will be still in our [forum](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python) hanging and talking to everyone. I really want to know how will your final project go and how you see life, now that you know how to program.

#Reading
This week I have no particular chapter for you to read, but of course you can always finish the readings that I left out from [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist]( http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/index.html) 

#Doing

We only have two more units left to do at Codecademy. Units [File Input and Output and Advanced topics in Python](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python ). Sounds interesting.

#Homework
This is it, the final assignment:

* Final Project – [__Tetris!__]( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/assignments/MIT6_189IAP11_final_proj.pdf )

 


That’s it.  When you’ve done that, you’re done.  But fear not–I am not going anywhere, so neither should you.  If you are running behind a little, take your time.  If you are done, feel free to hang with us on [forum](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python) and continue to help out other learners.

Thanks for joining me for this leap into a mechanical world – my world. I can't wait to see how you will 
evolve into righteous software engineer and please don't be a stranger. I want to hear all about how is it 
going.
