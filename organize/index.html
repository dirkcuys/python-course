					We are psyched that you are hosting a study group for the Gentle Introduction to Python. Adding a
					layer of social support around the course will lead to awesome learning opportunities for people in
					your community! We want to share a few things to help you. We also host a forum where you can talk
					with other facilitators: http://community.p2pu.org/c/facilitators.

		<div class="faq-item">
			<h3>I’m not an educator, can I host a study group?</h3>

			<p>Don’t worry. Many times the best teacher is someone taking a course with you. You don’t need to dig
				into any learning theory, but if we could share only 1 thing, this would be this, you learn better and
				enjoy learning a lot more when:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you feel like you belong in the community</li>
				<li>you feel like it’s possible to learn the subject matter</li>
				<li>you know that more effort translates to more success</li>
				<li>you understand why what you are learning is useful for you</li>
			</ul>

		<div class="faq-item">
			<h3>I don’t know python, can I be a facilitator?</h3>

			<p>Sure! Your role as facilitator is to coordinate the group and to get conversations started, not to be
				the teacher.

			<h3>Where should we meet?</h3>

			<p>If you don’t have a space in mind, you may consider asking a local library, a school with a computer lab or any place that works for the people in your study group.

		<div class="faq-item">
			<h3>How long should study group sessions be?</h3>

			<p>We’ve found that an hour and a half per week strikes a good balance between having enough time to do something meaningful, but not being too long for participants.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-item">
			<h3>What should we do during the sessions?</h3>

			<p>We encourage you to engage in activities that complements the existing course. Activities that we have found useful include
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>discussing the content in the course</li>
				<li>working on projects/assignments together</li>
			</ul>
